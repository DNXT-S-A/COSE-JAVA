# COSE-JAVA Implementation [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cose-wg/COSE-JAVA.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cose-wg/COSE-JAVA)

This project is a JAVA implementation of the IETF CBOR Encoded Message Syntax (COSE).
There are currently two versions of the COSE document that can be read.
The most current work in progress draft can be found on github in the [cose-wg/cose-spec](https://cose-wg.github.io/cose-spec/) project.
The IETF also keeps a copy of the spec in the [COSE WG](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cose-msg).

The project is implemented using Bouncy Castle for the crypto libraries and uses the PeterO CBOR library for its CBOR implementation.

## Contributing

Go ahead, file issues, make pull requests.

## Building

Right now I am using the NetBeans IDE and should at some point start doing automated check in testing.  Help there is both appreciated and desired.

## Documentation

Yes there should be some.  The API for this version, the C version and the C# version should all be very similar.
